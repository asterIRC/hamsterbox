  - Implemented remote /rehash taken mostly from jilles' patch to
    ircd-ratbox.
  - Took rehash code from ircd-ratbox as it is cleaner, and allows
    easier addition of rehash elements.
  - Corrected remote permission checking for kline/resv/xlines
    to use realhosts instead of hosts for those opers who
    do not use a conf spoof, and may use the cloaking system.

  Log:
  - Added new Channel{} option:
  
    * cycle_on_hostchange: when set to 'yes' this option causes
    * clients changing their hostname either via mode -/+ x, or
    * via services to appear to cycle all channels they are in.
    * They will leave with their old host and join with their new
    * one, and have the server reset their modes. This helps to       
    * keep address lists on clients synched.
  
    This option defaults to off. This is done in a way where
    It can be set on a server to server basis as it only affects
    local clients, making it easier to roll out.

  - Added UHNAMES support. When enabled by clients this allows the ircd
    to send full n!u@h data in /names output. This allows clients to
    fill their IAL without having to /who the channel. This can be
    enabled both via CAP and PROTOCTL. Currently supported by mIRC,
    klient, and a couple others. If the client doesnt enable the
    UHNAMES feature, the output will be the normal one.
  - Got rid of global /names. I do not see the point in having this,
    all it does now is flood clients off the server.
  - Updated 005 MAXTARGETS token with the new TARGMAX version.

  - Applied update from ratbox:
    - Do not send RPL_USERNOTINCHANNEL remotely (MODE +-qaohv, KICK).
      Sending them remotely causes UID leaks and is (IMHO) not very
      useful as the command was successful on the local server.

  - Applied upstream hybrid updates (r726 - r753):
    - fixed an old bug that affected our numeric delivery:
  
    Spotted by: stu
  
    Imagine we have a scenario like this:
    [origin A on server 0] --> [OUR IRCD] --> [TS6 server] --> [TS5 server and target Z]
  
    We'd try to address Z by its null ID only because the next server on the way
    is TS6.  That led to delivery failure in cases like
    ts6(origin)->ts6->ts6->ts5(target).

  - Applied upstream hybrid updates (r619 - r675):
    - Unbroke KILLHOST
    - Fixed an off-by one bug in the ip limiting code as reported by Volk
    - Fixed compile warning in change_simple_umode as reported by Volk
    - Added channel::disable_fake_channels which disallows creation of channels
      that have ascii 2, 3, 31 and 160 in their names.
    - Minor improvements and cleanups to channel name validation routines
      backported from 7.3
    - optimise Michael's fake channel catcher.
      Make it work first, then optimise.
    - At least I noticed it myself, I got it completely backwards
      when folding in Michael's suggested optimisation.
    - actually remove the chars that should not be marked as visible chan chars
    + added invisible character ^O (cancel all formatting)
    - Updated example configuration files
    - Fixed old bug that would forbid SPAMNUM to be disabled via "SET SPAMNUM 0"
    - Fixed bug that would exit unknown clients in check_unknowns_list() that are
      still processing auth/dns queries.
      Basically check_unknowns_list() should only exit clients that have finished
      auth/dns and didn't send a NICK/USER combination since they have been
      released from auth.
  
      Reported by ThaPrince.
    + backported numeric changes
    - Fixed compile error in s_auth.c
    - Fix compile error.  Be more careful with the so called stable branch :)
    - Rebuilt y.tab.(c|h) using bison 2.3
    - Bumped pcrelib version to 6.4.  There were no changes since 6.3 that would
      have affected our hacked version of the pcre library, so this is mainly to
      satisfy paranoid I-always-need-the-latest-version people
    - balloc.(c|h): backported r544 (Killed Block::used_list)
    - Update RELNOTES
    - Fixed class limit bug as spotted by stu.  ("REHASH" would always reset
      current user count)
    - Made "STATS y|Y" show inactive (deleted) classes that still have attached
      clients
    - Fixed possible core introduced by previous commit
    - Put some asserts into detach_conf()
    - check_classes(): Only call destroy_cidr_class() on a class that is ready
      for deletion, otherwise the current cidr count would become unadjusted in
      case a disabled class gets re-enabled later on.
    + patch against truncated NAMES output
  
      Submitted by: Murat Deligonul <deligonul@gmail.com>
  - Removed our previous port of the fake channel code in favor of the new upstream
    implementation.

    - ts6 fixes as explained on irc
    - Updated INSTALL.  --with-maxcon doesn't exist anymore

    - Update RELNOTES
    - log_user_exit(): removed extranous newline character in log message.
      fixed invalid casts

      Spotted by ThaPrince
    - Fixed compile warnings in log_user_exit()
  - Changed user logging to show realhosts instead of hosts.
  - Changed notices generated by opering to show realhosts instead of hosts.
  - Changed SVSNICK to try and generate a unique nickname in the case the nick
    the user is being changed to already exists, instead of killing the source
    or target. This behaviour will revert to killing only if it cannot generate
    a unique nickname after 10 tries.
  - Updated example conf files.

  Log:
  - Modified get_client_name() to show the realhost of a client instead of the vhost.
    This enables most if not all notices sent to opers concerning clients to have
    more relevent information shown. This change also means that if you want your
    hostname protected from WHOIS/notices and the like you will have to use a conf spoof.
  - Added in CAPTURE/UNCAPTURE support. When a client is captured they can not do anything
    due to the server ignoring all commands sent by them. Currently limited to netadmins. 
    This may not be set on an oper.
  - client->realhost is now populated with daya at the same time client->host is. This ensures that
    there is always data present in client->realhost for error messages etc.

  - Updated callerid numerics to display the correct type of callerid
    set on the user (G or g) instead of a blanket g. the reason was
    also updated based on type of callerid set.
  - Updated example confs, and added a example.rizon.quick file that
    leaves out most of the documentation in the file for a cleaner look.

      used by Unreal.
    - Changed numeric used when being denied from joining a SSLONLY
      channel to use ERR_CHANBANREASON as this is supported by most
      clients.
  - Increased default TOPICLEN to 390.
  - Allowed +a users to kick themselves if they so desire.
  - KILL's targeted at services clients or netadmins are now denied.
  - Allowed services clients to kick users from channels when not
    in the channel themselves.
  - Added channel owners and protected/admin users to list of users
    who may speak in can_send().

    This adds the +q and +a channel user status modes.
    the prefix for these are the same as unreal(~ and &) to remain

    --enable/disable-chanaq. They are enabled by default.
  - Allowed services clients to have the same privledges as servers
    when sending modes.
